# Render Kernel Improvement Loop

**Started**: 2026-05-09
**Goal**: Reduce all pages to < 2% pixel diff vs PyMuPDF reference, without regressing previously-fixed PDFs.
**Stop condition**: All pages < 2%, OR 3 consecutive iterations with no progress.

## Baseline (commit 182f1755 / run 2026-05-09_1249)

Per-PDF stats from initial harness run:

| PDF Version | PDF | Pages | min % | avg % | max % |
|------------|-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1.4 | Combinatie Raster, vector, tekening images.pdf | 1 | 8.6 | 8.6 | 8.6 |
| 1.4 | 20260316 - Barn Relocation - ... .pdf | 7 | 8.5 | 17.4 | 28.6 |
| 1.4 | 2885 Demo project.pdf | 14 | 7.0 | **54.9** | **100.0** |
| 1.6 | Zware vector PDF.pdf | 19 | 3.7 | 11.1 | 26.3 |
| 1.7 | Tekst.pdf | 5 | 96.2 | **96.2** | 96.2 |
| 1.7 | Text pdf gecombineerd.pdf | 28 | 0.3 | 19.7 | 72.7 |
| 1.7 | Technische tekening.pdf | 4 | 12.6 | 16.0 | 19.8 |
| 1.7 | rapport-constructie.pdf | 28 | 0.3 | 19.7 | 72.7 |

**Totals**: 106 pages, 6 passed (≤ 2%), 100 failed.

**Top hypothesis areas**:
1. **Tekst.pdf** — every page 96.2%. Pure text PDF; suggests fundamental text-rendering gap.
2. **2885 Demo project page 9 = 100%** — entire page rendering wrong/blank.
3. **rapport-constructie & Text pdf gecombineerd identical diff numbers** — both are typical-text+image v1.7 PDFs; failure modes likely related.
4. **Zware vector PDF** at v1.6 is least-bad — vector rendering is closer to PyMuPDF; raster/text is the harder gap.

## Iterations

### Iteration 0 — Setup (this entry)
- Improvement log created
- Baseline analyzed: 100/106 fail at 2% threshold
- Strategy: tackle highest-leverage failures first (Tekst.pdf single root cause, then 2885 Demo project page 9, then text v1.7 set, then v1.4 set, then v1.6).

### Iteration 1 — Tekst.pdf (v1.7 text)

**Investigation findings**:
- Font situation: F1 = embedded Type1 subset (`/BAAAAA+UniviaProRegular`, FontFile, ToUnicode CMap, custom Encoding via `0 1 255 {1 index exch /.notdef put} for` + per-glyph `dup N /name put`); F2 = embedded TrueType subset (`/CAAAAA+Calibri`, FontFile2). Both use `/Encoding=None` (font's built-in encoding). hayro-font parses the Type1 encoding+CharStrings correctly (verified via `examples/probe_type1.rs`: all 73 subset glyphs have outlines).
- Visual symptom: app render was a solid green page (every pixel `(133,169,157)`) with faint table grid lines. Reference is a normal letterhead with text. Sampling app pixels showed essentially one color across the whole canvas — text completely missing AND background image collapsed to a single sample.
- Root cause: **`Interpreter::execute_internal` (the server-side `render_page` path used by MCP `screenshot_page`) treats every text operator as a no-op** (`open-pdf-render/src/interpreter.rs:225` had `"BT" | "ET" | "Tf" | ... | "Tj" | "TJ" | ... => {}`). The Tj/TJ glyph-painting code only ran in the `extract_commands*` path (which produces a draw-command buffer for JS-side replay, not for the rasterizer used by the harness). Secondary defect uncovered: `SkiaRenderer::draw_image` passed `gs.ctm` straight to `tiny_skia::draw_pixmap` — but `draw_pixmap`'s transform maps SOURCE PIXEL space to destination, while the PDF Image XObject CTM maps the unit square (1×1) to destination. Without pre-scaling by `1/width, 1/height`, only the source pixel `(0,0)` lands on the canvas, stretched edge-to-edge by the bilinear filter (hence the uniform color).

**Fix**:
- `open-pdf-render/src/text_renderer.rs`: added `render_text_glyphs_skia` and `render_cid_text_glyphs_skia` — direct-to-`SkiaRenderer` analogs of the existing buffer-emitting functions, mirroring the same PDF spec §9.4.4 geometry per glyph.
- `open-pdf-render/src/interpreter.rs`: threaded `&mut FontRegistry` through `execute`, `execute_with_image_limit`, `execute_internal`, and `handle_do_execute`. Replaced the no-op text-operator catch-all with full implementations of `BT/ET/Tf/Tc/Tw/Tz/TL/Ts/Tr/Td/TD/Tm/T*/Tj/TJ/'/"`. Added `execute_show_string` and `execute_show_array` helpers that resolve the font and dispatch to simple- or CID-glyph painting on the SkiaRenderer.
- `open-pdf-render/src/parser.rs`: locked the document-scoped `font_registry` and forwarded it to the interpreter so glyph-outline parses are still cached across pages.
- `open-pdf-render/src/renderer.rs`: pre-concatenated `1/width × 1/height` into the image transform inside `draw_image` so source-pixel coords map correctly through the unit square to the destination.

**Verification**:
- Tekst.pdf: 96.17% → 3.99% avg (delta -92.18%). Per page: p0 96.17→3.88, p1 96.17→3.76, p2 96.17→4.89, p3 96.17→6.58, p4 96.17→0.85 (PASS).
- Combinatie (sanity check): 8.56% → 3.47% (improved, did not regress).
- Full-suite totals: 6/106 → 25/106 passing. Average diff dropped on 7/8 PDFs:
  - Zware vector PDF: 11.13 → 2.15
  - 20260316 Barn Relocation: 17.45 → 4.00
  - Technische tekening: 15.97 → 14.65 (small)
  - rapport-constructie / Text pdf gecombineerd: 19.66 → 8.33
  - 2885 Demo project: 54.89 → 22.34
- Two pages regressed visually (rapport-constructie p0: 32.84→50.47, p27: 13.56→61.84). Both previously rendered ENTIRELY BLANK; my fix now correctly draws everything except a JPEG image with `/SMask` (soft alpha mask). The renderer doesn't honor SMask, so the image draws fully opaque (a black rectangle) where the reference shows it composited with transparency. This is a separate, pre-existing image-decoding gap that my fix exposed but did not introduce — the previous "lower" diff number on those pages came from the page being mostly white-on-white instead of actually correct rendering. Recommend tackling SMask in a follow-up iteration.

### Iteration 2 — 2885 Demo project (v1.4 image-heavy, transparency)

**Iter-1 baseline** (run 2026-05-09_1352-ed55cea0): 25/106 pages passing. 2885 Demo project: avg 22.34%, worst page 9 = 98.05%, page 0 = 96.47%.

**Investigation findings**:
- Target pages: 9 (98.05%) and 0 (96.47%).
- Visual symptom: large background photograph on each page is rendered fully opaque/saturated, but the reference shows it semi-transparent (washed-out, faded). On page 0, an additional decorative diamond/hexagon shape is painted opaque white where it should be translucent.
- Resource inventory (pikepdf): both pages use a single Form XObject (X12/X15) with `/Group /S /Transparency`. Inside that form, the image-bearing inner Form XObjects are invoked under `/G6 gs` (`/ca` = 0.32 on p9, 0.61 on p0) and `/G9 gs` (`/ca` = 0.65) ExtGState entries — these are constant-alpha values for non-stroking ops. The inner forms also have transparency groups and use `/G3 gs` (`/ca` = 1) internally.
- Root cause: the `gs` operator (set-graphics-state-from-ExtGState-name) was a no-op in `Interpreter::execute_internal` (`interpreter.rs:306`). `/ca` and `/CA` were never read, so every fill/image painted at 100% opacity. Additionally, PDF transparency-group Form XObjects require the *parent* alpha to wrap the entire group as if compositing — the inner form's own `/G3 gs` (ca=1) must not erase the parent's accumulated 0.32.

**Fix**:
- `open-pdf-render/src/graphics_state.rs`: added `fill_alpha`, `stroke_alpha`, `group_fill_alpha`, `group_stroke_alpha` fields (defaults 1.0) and `effective_fill_alpha`/`effective_stroke_alpha` accessors that return the product. The save/restore via `q`/`Q` already covers them through `Clone`.
- `open-pdf-render/src/interpreter.rs`: implemented the `gs` operator (`apply_ext_gstate`) — looks up the named ExtGState in resources and reads `/ca` → `fill_alpha`, `/CA` → `stroke_alpha`. In `handle_do_execute`, when entering a Form XObject whose `/Group /S` is `/Transparency`, the parent's `fill_alpha`/`stroke_alpha` are folded into the group multipliers and the in-group alphas reset to 1.0 — this approximates PDF transparency-group compositing without needing an off-screen pixmap.
- `open-pdf-render/src/renderer.rs`: `fill`, `stroke`, `fill_and_stroke`, and `draw_image` now multiply `effective_fill_alpha()` / `effective_stroke_alpha()` into the paint alpha / `PixmapPaint::opacity`.

**Verification**:
- 2885 Demo project page 9: 98.05% → 4.26% (-93.79%).
- 2885 Demo project page 0: 96.47% → 10.60% (-85.87%); diamond shape still opaque (a deeper transparency-group-on-image-paths case for next iteration).
- 2885 Demo project page 1: 5.98% → 0.41% (now PASS).
- 2885 Demo project avg: 22.34% → 9.11% (-13.23%).
- 2885 Demo project worst: 98.05% → 41.76%.
- Full-suite avg: 8.78% → 7.03%.
- Full-suite passing: 25/106 → 26/106.
- Other PDFs delta: no page changed by > 1pp aside from the three 2885 wins above. No regressions.

**Total passing**: 25/106 → 26/106

### Iteration 3 — Image /SMask soft alpha (rapport-constructie / Text pdf gecombineerd p0 + p27)

**Iter-2 baseline** (run 2026-05-09_1413-e3f5e26b): 26/106 passing. Top remaining failures: rapport-constructie p27 = 61.84%, p0 = 50.47% (both also present in identical-failures Text pdf gecombineerd).

**Investigation findings**:
- Resources on rapport-constructie p0: a single Image XObject `/Image9` 1653×2338, DeviceRGB, FlateDecode, with `/SMask` → DeviceGray 8 bpc FlateDecode 1653×2338 (`/Matte [0 0 0]`). Page content stream: header artifacts + a single `/Image9 Do`. Page 27 is the same shape with `/Image175` (also has SMask).
- Visual symptom: the regions of the image that should be transparent (revealing the white page) were rendered as a giant solid black rectangle. Opaque parts of the image (logo, blue title block, colored shape clusters) rendered correctly. Looked exactly like the SMask was being thrown away and the black /Matte pre-multiplied colour was bleeding through.
- Root cause: `Interpreter::decode_raw_image` (server-side render path used by the harness) and `Interpreter::handle_image_xobject` (browser-side draw-command path) both built RGBA buffers with the alpha byte hard-coded to `255`. The image dictionary's `/SMask` entry was never resolved or read, so the per-pixel soft alpha was discarded. Tiny-skia's pixmap loader requires premultiplied RGBA, so any future alpha < 255 also needs the colour channels premultiplied.

**Fix** — `open-pdf-render/src/interpreter.rs`:
- `decode_raw_image` (server-side): resolve `/SMask` (Stream or Reference→Stream), confirm Width/Height match the parent image (skip otherwise — resampling is a future improvement), call `decompress_image_stream` to recover the alpha bytes, then plug those bytes into the per-pixel RGBA `a` slot. Premultiply R/G/B by `a` because `tiny_skia::PixmapRef::from_bytes` requires premultiplied input. CMYK and grayscale paths also premultiply.
- `handle_image_xobject` (browser-side): same SMask resolution + premultiplied RGBA emission, so the JS `vector-renderer` path matches the server.
- `/Matte` un-matting deliberately skipped this iteration — the silhouette alone fixes the visible black-rectangle artefact; un-matting is a refinement for sub-pixel mask edges.

**Verification** (run 2026-05-09_1422-e3f5e26b vs iter-2 baseline):
- Text pdf gecombineerd p27: 61.84% → 0.55% (FAIL → PASS) — -61.29pp.
- rapport-constructie p27: 61.84% → 0.55% (FAIL → PASS) — -61.29pp.
- Text pdf gecombineerd p0: 50.47% → 1.21% (FAIL → PASS) — -49.26pp.
- rapport-constructie p0: 50.47% → 1.21% (FAIL → PASS) — -49.26pp.
- Bonus wins (other PDFs with SMask images):
  - 2885 Demo project p7: 41.76% → 8.27% (-33.49pp).
  - 2885 Demo project p3: 12.10% → 2.44% (-9.65pp).
  - 2885 Demo project p9: 4.26% → 1.08% (FAIL → PASS).
- Zero regressions — no page worsened by more than 0.1pp.
- Visual confirmation: cover page now matches reference with correct transparency around the logo and shapes; previously transparent regions are white, not black.

**Total passing**: 26/106 → 31/106 (+5)

### Iteration 4 — `w 0` zero-width strokes (Technische tekening v1.7 engineering drawings)

**Iter-3 baseline** (run 2026-05-09_1429-a25d336e): 31/106 passing. Technische tekening 0/4 pass with avg 14.65% (p0 12.82, p1 18.42, p2 15.90, p3 11.48). Iter-1, -2, -3 barely moved this PDF (15.97 → 14.65 across 3 iterations).

**Investigation findings**:
- Resource inventory (pikepdf): all 4 pages are A1 landscape (`/MediaBox [0 0 1684 2384]` plus `/Rotate 90`); single `/GT255` ExtGState with `/ca=1, /CA=1` (no transparency); fonts are `/Type0 /Identity-H` with `/CIDFontType2` descendants pointing at embedded ArialMT/Arial-Bold/Arial-Black/ArialNova-Light TrueType subsets. No images, no shadings, no patterns. Just heavy linework.
- Content-stream operator profile (PyMuPDF `read_contents`): on page 0, `l` (line-to) 2424×, `m` (move-to) 2155×, `w` (set-width) 1857×, `S` (stroke) 1692×, `c` (curve) 472×, `b` (close+fill+stroke) 243×, `j`/`M` 229×/225×. Pages 1-3 are similar but heavier (4898/3943/2303 `w` ops).
- **Critical**: regex `(\\d+\\.?\\d*)\\s+w` extraction shows **every single `w` operator across all 4 pages uses width 0** (page 0: 1857/1857 = 100%; pages 1-3: same 100%). This is an AutoCAD-exported PDF — AutoCAD writes `0 w` for "thinnest line" per PDF spec §8.4.3.2.
- Visual symptom: app render shows the floor-plan heating coils as bold, fully-opaque colored polylines (red/green/blue zigzags), text labels are missing or buried, dark-pixel count is 2.0-2.8× the reference. Reference render shows the same coils as faint, almost ghostly thin lines, with text labels clearly readable above the floor plan.
- Root cause: `tiny_skia::Stroke::width = 0.0` triggers `treat_as_hairline` → returns `Some(1.0)` (full-coverage 1-pixel hairline) per `painter.rs:553`. PyMuPDF/MuPDF render the same width-0 strokes as faint sub-pixel hairlines (per the spec's note that on high-resolution devices, width-0 lines are "nearly invisible"). The 1.0-coverage hairline is 2-3× heavier than the reference.

**Fix** — `open-pdf-render/src/renderer.rs`:
- New helper `SkiaRenderer::resolve_stroke_width(gs)` that returns `gs.line_width` unchanged when positive, but for `gs.line_width == 0.0` substitutes a tiny user-space width such that the device-space width (after CTM) is `~0.2 px`. Calculation: extract dominant CTM scale via `sqrt(sx*sx + kx*kx) * sqrt(ky*ky + sy*sy)` geometric mean (rotation-invariant), then return `0.2 / scale`. After CTM applies, tiny_skia's `treat_as_hairline` returns `~0.2` coverage — a low-opacity 1px hairline that visually matches the reference.
- `stroke()` and `fill_and_stroke()` both call the new helper. `fill_and_stroke()` previously also dropped `line_cap`/`line_join`/`miter_limit`/`dash_array` on the floor — fixed those at the same time.
- Knob-tuning sweep: tried `0.5/0.4/0.3/0.25/0.2/0.18` device pixels. `0.2` is the sweet spot (3 of 4 pages PASS; lower values lose stroke detail, higher leaves them too dark).

**Verification** (run 2026-05-09_1505-a25d336e vs iter-3 baseline):
- Technische tekening per-page:
  - p0: 12.82% → **1.95% (PASS)** — -10.87pp
  - p1: 18.42% → 2.89% (FAIL but very close) — -15.53pp
  - p2: 15.90% → **0.76% (PASS)** — -15.14pp
  - p3: 11.48% → **1.03% (PASS)** — -10.45pp
  - avg: 14.65% → 1.66% — **-12.99pp**
- Bounded blast radius: only 1 of 8 PDFs (Text pdf gecombineerd) has any `w 0` operators (1 of 16, 6%); the other 6 PDFs have zero `w 0`. Confirmed by re-running the full suite — every page outside Technische tekening has the EXACT same diff% as the iter-3 baseline (`Text pdf gecombineerd: 7/28 4.39%`, `rapport-constructie: 7/28 4.39%`, `2885 Demo project: 2/14 5.80%`, `Zware vector PDF: 12/19 2.15%`, `Barn Relocation: 2/7 4.00%`, `Tekst.pdf: 1/5 3.99%`, `Combinatie: 0/1 3.47%` — all unchanged). Zero regressions.
- Total passing: 31/106 → **34/106 (+3)**.

### Iteration 5 — In-flight scale-convention fix verified by rebuild (no NEW code change)

**Iter-4 baseline** (per improvement-log): 34/106 passing. Cluster Text pdf gecombineerd / rapport-constructie: 7/28 each, avg 4.39%, worst page p8 = 9.0%.

**Investigation findings**:
- pikepdf inspection of Text pdf gecombineerd p8: standard A4 portrait (595.32×841.92), Rotate=0, fonts F1=Calibri-Light embedded TrueType subset, F2=Arial-BoldMT non-embedded, F3=ArialMT non-embedded, F4=SymbolMT, F5=Calibri-LightItalic embedded, F6=Type0/Calibri-Light embedded. No images on this page, no shadings/patterns, only ExtGState GS7/GS8 with /ca=/CA=1. Heavy TJ usage (249 ops on this page, F1 dominant). Same font signature on rapport-constructie.
- Visual diff inspection at the iter-4 deployed binary: app render dimensions = **1415×2000** against ref of 2000×2829. Reading `mcp_server.rs` showed `let scale = width as f32 / w_pt;` (literal width), which would produce 2000×2829 — but the running binary clearly was not following that rule.
- Source-of-truth check: writing a standalone `examples/test_dim.rs` against the published-on-disk `open-pdf-render` crate confirmed the kernel correctly produces 2000×2829 from `width=2000, w_pt=595.32, scale=3.359`. So the bug was only in what was compiled into the exe, not in the current source tree.
- Root cause: an in-flight uncommitted change to `open-pdf-studio/src-tauri/src/mcp_server.rs` had switched `scale = width / w_pt.max(h_pt)` → `scale = width / w_pt` (literal width to match PyMuPDF), but a `cargo build --release` had not been run since the change. The deployed exe (mtime 15:13) was still using the previous `max(w_pt, h_pt)` denominator → portrait A4 pages rendered at 2000/841.92 = 2.376× scale → 1415×2000 output → LANCZOS upscale to ref size → blurred anti-aliased text edges → 5-9% diff bands tracking text density.

**Action**: rebuilt `src-tauri` with `cargo build --release` (55 s). This compiled the in-flight `mcp_server.rs` literal-width-scale fix into the exe. NO new code was introduced in this iteration — the value comes entirely from a previously-committed-elsewhere fix that hadn't yet been linked into the running binary. The `mcp_server.rs` change remains uncommitted (it was an in-flight change before this iteration started).

**Verification** (run 2026-05-09_1541-01495dc7, full suite):
- Text pdf gecombineerd: avg 4.39 → 2.99 (-1.40pp), worst page 8.97 → 6.85 (-2.12pp), passing 7/28 → 11/28 (+4 pages: p1, p14, p16, p19, p25 now PASS).
- rapport-constructie: identical numbers (this PDF tracks Text pdf gecombineerd page-by-page in every iteration so far).
- 2885 Demo project: 2/14 PASS (worst page 11.39%, was 41.76% iter-2). Some side-effect improvement.
- Tekst.pdf: 1/5 PASS (p4 = 0.68%); p0-p3 in 2.16-3.70% range — just over the 2% threshold but visually correct.
- Zware vector PDF: 12/19 PASS (best PDF in suite); avg 2.15%.
- Technische tekening: 3/4 PASS (unchanged from iter-4).
- Combinatie / Barn Relocation: 0/1 and 2/7 PASS respectively.

**Total passing**: 34/106 → **42/106 (+8 pages)**. No regressions on previously-passing pages. All gains are on text-heavy portrait pages where the resolution mismatch had been costing 1-2 percentage points of diff.

**Concerns**:
- The +8 improvement is real but is owed to an in-flight, uncommitted `mcp_server.rs` fix that the previous iteration never linked into the binary. This iteration's actual contribution is the diagnosis (stale binary vs in-flight source) and the rebuild — no new Rust changes were made and no commit was created for `open-pdf-render/`.
- The next real iteration should target the remaining text-page diffs (Text pdf gecombineerd p8/11 still ≈ 6.85%). Visual inspection shows a faint horizontal grey-blue stripe across the bottom ~4 rows of the app render that's absent from the ref — looks like a clipped page-footer rectangle. Worth investigating in iter-6.
- Consider adding a build-freshness assertion to the regression harness (compare exe mtime against `src/**/*.rs` mtimes; warn loudly if Rust sources are newer) so future loops don't chase stale-binary artefacts.

**Commit**: none. No `open-pdf-render` changes; this entry is documentation only.

### Iteration 6 — Path clipping `W` / `W*` (Barn Relocation v1.4 Bluebeam-stapled construction permit)

**Iter-5 baseline** (run 2026-05-09_1541-01495dc7 per improvement-log + 2026-05-09_1550-80da0486 fresh re-run): 42/106 passing. Barn Relocation page 6 = 13.59%, the worst single page in the suite. Other Barn pages (p0-p5) all between 0.90% and 4.64%.

**Investigation findings**:
- Visual diff: app render's right side is dominated by a HUGE solid grey rectangle where the reference shows a delicate column-on-footing structural detail. The bottom-left construction detail similarly shows oversized grey blocks with hatching missing.
- Resource inventory (pikepdf): page is A1 landscape (`/MediaBox [0 0 1584 2448]` `/Rotate 90`). 16 DCT-JPEG images of varying sizes (94×1662 down to 147×44, plus a 3535×94 footer band and the giant 3077×2204 main `/R24`); single CenturyGothic TrueType font; no transparency groups; no shadings/patterns.
- Content-stream pattern: the page is a ~1.9 MB stream that wraps every image-paint sequence in nested `q ... [clip-rect] re W n q [transform] cm /RXX Do Q Q`. The `W n` pair at the inner level is supposed to constrain the image to a small inner rectangle even though the image is placed by a transform that scales it to fill the page. Without clipping, the image draws across the entire page.
- Root cause: **`W`/`W*` operators were no-ops in the SkiaRenderer interpreter path** (`open-pdf-render/src/interpreter.rs:229` had `"W" | "W*" => {}`). The `GraphicsState` already declared a `clip_path: Option<tiny_skia::Path>` field but nothing populated it, and none of `fill`/`stroke`/`fill_and_stroke`/`draw_image` passed a mask to tiny_skia. So every clipping rectangle that was supposed to constrain a `Do` image (or path) drew the full source content uncropped — for the page-6 footing detail this meant the 3077×2204 photo of a wall-section drawing painted across most of the right half of the page as a solid grey block. The same gap was costing diff% on every page in the suite that uses `re W n` framing (very common — virtually every PDF generator emits clip rects to bound images and form XObjects).

**Fix**:
- `open-pdf-render/src/graphics_state.rs`: changed `clip_path: Option<tiny_skia::Path>` → `clip_path: Option<tiny_skia::Mask>`. The mask is a pixmap-sized 8-bit alpha buffer (white = pass, black = block) that tiny_skia's `fill_path`/`stroke_path`/`draw_pixmap` accept as the `mask` parameter. `q` clones the mask via `Clone`; `Q` restores the parent mask, giving correct PDF clip-stack semantics for free.
- `open-pdf-render/src/renderer.rs`: stored pixmap dimensions on `SkiaRenderer`. Added `snapshot_path()` which clones the path-builder and finishes it without consuming (so the same path can be both painted and clipped). Added `apply_clip(gs, path, even_odd)` which either creates a new `Mask::new(w, h)` and `fill_path`s the path into it, or `intersect_path`s into the existing mask. Both use `gs.ctm` so the clip is in pixmap pixel coordinates. Threaded `gs.clip_path.as_ref()` into all four `fill_path` / `stroke_path` / `draw_pixmap` call sites in `fill`, `stroke`, `fill_and_stroke`, `draw_image`.
- `open-pdf-render/src/interpreter.rs`: added `pending_clip: Option<bool>` (the bool is the even-odd flag). `W` sets `Some(false)`; `W*` sets `Some(true)`. At the head of every iteration, if a paint or no-op operator (S/s/f/F/f*/B/B*/b/b*/n) is about to run AND `pending_clip` is set, snapshot the current path and apply it to `state.current.clip_path` before the paint op consumes the path builder. This matches the PDF spec's two-step "W then S" semantics and falls through `q`/`Q` automatically.

**Verification** (run 2026-05-09_1600-80da0486, full suite):
- **Barn Relocation page 6: 13.59% → 1.82% (FAIL → PASS)** — the targeted -11.77pp win. Visual confirms the giant grey rectangle is gone and the column/footing detail renders correctly.
- Bonus wins from clipping fix landing across the suite (no other PDF was deliberately targeted):
  - 2885 Demo project: 2/14 PASS → **9/14 PASS (+7)**. p0 1.15% (was 10.60), p3 1.26 (was 2.44), p5 1.76, p7 1.83 (was 8.27), p9 1.08, p10 0.81, p11 1.15 — all newly passing because their image-on-image transparency-group renders had been bleeding outside their intended clip rects.
  - Text pdf gecombineerd / rapport-constructie: 11/28 → 12/28 each (p0 1.27% from previously near-passing).
  - Barn Relocation: 2/7 → 3/7 (page 6 now passes, page 1 still passes).
- Zero regressions. Every page that was already passing in iter-5 is still passing. Worst page in suite is now 8.09% (2885 p4) — the high-water mark dropped from 13.59 to 8.09.
- **Total passing: 42/106 → 52/106 (+10)**. Average diff dropped on 4 of 8 PDFs; 2885 Demo project went from 4/14 → 9/14 PASS (avg 5.10 → 3.02).

**Concerns / next ideas**:
- The remaining failures cluster around text-edge antialiasing differences (Text pdf gecombineerd p2/4/8/11 in the 2-7% band). These look like sub-pixel font rendering deltas, not missing operators. Lower-leverage from here.
- 2885 Demo project p4 = 8.09% is now the worst page; visual inspection would be the next iter target if pursuing < 7%.
- Tekst.pdf p0-p3 still in 2.16-3.70% just-over-the-line band — same anti-aliasing story.

### Iteration 7 — Glyph-origin device-pixel snapping (text-edge AA matches MuPDF)

**Iter-6 baseline** (run 2026-05-09_1600-80da0486): 52/106 passing. Worst page in suite was 2885 Demo project p4 at 8.09%. Several other 2885 pages clustered in the 5-8% band (p2 5.66, p6 5.20, p8 6.12, p13 5.91), as did Text pdf gecombineerd / rapport-constructie p8/11 (~6.5-6.7%) and Tekst.pdf p0-p3 (2.16-3.70%, just over the 2% threshold).

**Investigation findings**:
- Page 4 of 2885 is structurally trivial: a single Form XObject `/X8` with `/Group /S /Transparency /I true` containing 1091 `Tj` ops over 3 embedded TrueType-subset CID fonts (NotoSans-Regular, TAN-PEARL-Regular, SeN-CB). No images, no shadings, no patterns, no nested transparency.
- Visual inspection (`Drijvend bouwen…` body paragraph, row 280, col 100-200): both ref and app render the text correctly and align byte-for-byte at the **stem interiors** (full-ink purple = `[59, 27, 61]` in both renders). The diff is concentrated on **glyph anti-aliased edge pixels** — same column, but ref has e.g. left-edge AA value `120` (53% ink coverage) and right-edge `228` (11% coverage), while app produces a more symmetric `206` (19%) / `157` (38%) pattern. Mean text-pixel intensity: ref 69.1, app 73.3 (app is ~6% lighter); pixels < 50 (very dark): ref 207338 vs app 226048 (app has 9% MORE fully-inked pixels).
- Cross-correlation to detect a global x/y shift: minimum mean-abs-diff is at offset (0, 0). So glyphs are positioned at the right places — what differs is the **per-glyph sub-pixel placement** of each origin within its target pixel cell.
- Root cause: `text_renderer::render_text_glyphs_skia` and `render_cid_text_glyphs_skia` compute glyph origin as `(gx, gy) = (rise·tm[2] + tm[4], rise·tm[3] + tm[5])` — i.e. the accumulated sub-pixel position from successive `tx = (w0·Tfs + Tc + Tw) · Th` advances. tiny_skia then rasterises each glyph at its full sub-pixel origin. PyMuPDF/MuPDF (and most production rasterizers — FreeType, Cairo, Skia) **snap each glyph origin to the nearest integer device pixel** before scan-converting the outline. Without snapping, our glyph stems straddle two columns at fractional offset, producing a wider/softer AA edge profile than the reference's snapped, crisper edges.

**Fix** — `open-pdf-render/src/text_renderer.rs`:
- New `snap_glyph_origin(gx, gy, ctm) -> (gx', gy')` helper. Forward-maps the user-space origin through the current CTM to device space, rounds both components to the nearest integer, then inverse-maps back to user space. If the CTM is non-invertible, falls back to the unsnapped origin.
- Both `render_text_glyphs_skia` (simple-encoded fonts) and `render_cid_text_glyphs_skia` (Identity-H/Identity-V Type0 fonts) call the helper before `state.concat_matrix(...)`. Glyph outlines are then rasterised at the pixel-aligned origin while still inheriting the full font-size scale from the text matrix.
- The `tm[4]/tm[5]` advance accumulator is **not** snapped — only the per-glyph painting origin. Text layout (kerning, justification) stays accurate; only the rasterisation grid alignment changes.

**Verification** (run 2026-05-09_1626-4dfae30a, full suite):
- **2885 Demo project p4: 8.09% → 0.08% (FAIL → PASS)** — the targeted -8.01pp win. The high-water-mark page is now near-perfect.
- Bonus 2885 wins (text-heavy pages with same root cause):
  - p2: 5.66% → 0.06% (FAIL → PASS, -5.60pp).
  - p6: 5.20% → 0.05% (FAIL → PASS, -5.15pp).
  - p8: 6.12% → 6.07% (still FAIL but slightly better).
  - p13: 5.91% → 5.70% (still FAIL but slightly better).
  - 2885 net: 9/14 → **12/14** PASS (+3); avg diff -1.55pp.
- Tekst.pdf wins:
  - p0: 2.45% → 1.97% (FAIL → PASS).
  - p1: 2.16% → 1.86% (FAIL → PASS).
  - p4: 0.68% → 0.53%.
  - Tekst net: 1/5 → **3/5** PASS (+2); avg diff -0.45pp.
- Regressions (4 borderline pages — all were within 0.2pp of the 2% threshold):
  - Technische tekening p0: 1.96% → 2.13% (PASS → FAIL, +0.18).
  - Barn Relocation p6: 1.82% → 2.06% (PASS → FAIL, +0.24).
  - Text pdf gecombineerd p22: 1.98% → 2.99% (PASS → FAIL, +1.01).
  - rapport-constructie p22: 1.98% → 2.99% (PASS → FAIL, +1.01) — same content as Text pdf gecombineerd p22.
- Average diff change per PDF: 2885 -1.55pp, Tekst -0.45pp, Text/rapport -0.09pp, Zware vector +0.16pp, Barn +0.13pp, Technische +0.21pp, Combinatie +0.07pp. Net positive on the heaviest-failing PDF, slight regression on already-passing PDFs (snapping shifts the AA pattern by half a pixel either way; sometimes that aligns better with the reference, sometimes worse).
- **Total passing: 52/106 → 53/106 (+1 net)**. Five FAIL→PASS wins offset four PASS→FAIL regressions. The high-water mark went from 8.09% to 6.41% (Text pdf gecombineerd p8).

**Concerns / next ideas**:
- The four PASS→FAIL regressions all sit between 2.0 and 3.0% — they were borderline before and the snap shifted them just over. A smarter snap (e.g. snap only when the fractional part is > some threshold, or only snap one axis) might recover some without losing the 2885/Tekst gains.
- Several pages now in the 5-6% band (Text/rapport p8/11/17/20/21, 2885 p8/p13, Zware p3/p5) — same text-rasterizer-difference shape as iter-7 targeted. Most likely need additional rasterizer-level work (gamma-correct AA, stem snapping, font hinting) which is more invasive than this iteration.
- Worth investigating: could `tiny_skia::Paint::force_hq_pipeline` or different stroke/fill quality knobs nudge the AA closer? Current `paint.anti_alias = true` is already on.

### Iteration 8 — Snap refinement: axis-aligned-only glyph snapping (Path A)

**Iter-7 baseline** (per improvement-log entry above): 53/106 passing. Four PASS→FAIL regressions from iter-7's unconditional glyph snap: Technische tekening p0 (1.96 → 2.13), Barn Relocation p6 (1.82 → 2.06), Text pdf gecombineerd p22 (1.98 → 2.99), rapport-constructie p22 (1.98 → 2.99).

**Path chosen**: A — refine the snap. Path B (chasing 5-7% pages) requires deeper rasterizer-level work (stem snapping, gamma-correct AA, font hinting) that is more invasive than the available time budget. Path A's idea #1 (snap only when CTM is axis-aligned) has a clean, falsifiable hypothesis backed by pikepdf inspection of the regressed pages.

**Investigation findings**:
- pikepdf inspection of the four iter-7 regressed pages: Technische tekening p0 (`/Rotate 90`, MediaBox 1684×2384), Barn Relocation p6 (`/Rotate 90`, MediaBox 1584×2448), Text pdf gecombineerd p22 (`/Rotate 0`), rapport-constructie p22 (`/Rotate 0`). 2 of 4 regressions are on `/Rotate 90` pages.
- For `/Rotate 90` pages, the page-level rotation is folded into the initial CTM (parser.rs lines 358-370), so `state.current.ctm.kx` and `ctm.ky` are non-zero throughout the page render. Iter-7's snap rounds the device-space origin to integer pixels, but on a rotated CTM the inverse-mapped user-space origin gets shifted along the perpendicular advance direction — the snap moves each glyph's stem by up to half a pixel along its visible vertical axis, producing AA edge patterns that don't match the reference.
- For `/Rotate 0` pages with axis-aligned text (Tekst, 2885 wins), `kx=ky=0` and the snap produces the desired horizontal pixel-grid alignment with no spurious vertical shift.
- The two unrotated regressions (Text/rapport p22) are harder — the snap creates a 1pp regression on an axis-aligned page. Likely a content-specific AA-pattern mismatch that would need a different refinement (idea #4 cumulative-error tracking) to recover; out of scope for iter-8.

**Hypothesis**: Restrict the snap to pages where the CTM has negligible rotation/skew (`kx.abs() < 1e-3 && ky.abs() < 1e-3`). This recovers the two `/Rotate 90` regressions while preserving every iter-7 win (which was on rotation-0 pages).

**Fix** — `open-pdf-render/src/text_renderer.rs`:
- `snap_glyph_origin` now checks `ctm.kx.abs() > AXIS_ALIGNED_EPS || ctm.ky.abs() > AXIS_ALIGNED_EPS` at entry and returns the unsnapped origin in that case. Only the rounding path was guarded — the inverse-CTM math is unchanged otherwise.
- `AXIS_ALIGNED_EPS = 1e-3` — generous enough to handle floating-point noise on identity-scale CTMs, tight enough to reject any real rotation (`sin(0.1°) ≈ 1.7e-3`).
- Updated docstring to record why the guard exists (iter-7 regressions).

**Verification** (full suite run 2026-05-09_1641-5f6ebc9a vs iter-7 baseline run):
- **Technische tekening p0: 2.13% → 1.96% (FAIL → PASS)** — recovered, -0.17pp.
- **Barn Relocation p6: 2.06% → 1.82% (FAIL → PASS)** — recovered, -0.24pp.
- Text pdf gecombineerd p22: 2.99% → 2.99% (still FAIL) — not recovered (axis-aligned page, snap still applies).
- rapport-constructie p22: 2.99% → 2.99% (still FAIL) — same as above.
- All iter-7 2885 wins preserved: p2 0.06, p4 0.08, p6 0.05 — all still PASS.
- All iter-7 Tekst wins preserved: p0 1.97, p1 1.86 — both still PASS.
- Per-PDF passing: Barn 2/7→3/7, Technische tekening 2/4→3/4, 2885 12/14, Tekst 3/5, Text/rapport 12/28 each, Zware vector 12/19, Combinatie 0/1.
- **Total passing: 53/106 → 55/106 (+2 net)**. Zero regressions; only the two `/Rotate 90` recoveries moved.

**Concerns / next ideas**:
- The two remaining iter-7 regressions (Text/rapport p22 at 2.99%) are on axis-aligned pages so this iteration cannot recover them. They need either idea #4 (cumulative subpixel error across a glyph run) or a content-aware approach. Probably 1 or 2pp recoverable but more invasive.
- High-water mark unchanged (Text/rapport p8 = 6.41%). Several pages still cluster in 4-7% band — same text-rasterizer-difference family that iter-7 partially attacked.
- Worst PDF in current state is Zware vector PDF (12/19 PASS, avg ~2.2%, several pages 3-5%) — these are vector-heavy scientific drawing pages that would benefit from a path-rendering iteration rather than text snapping.
- The `1e-3` epsilon comfortably distinguishes axis-aligned from rotated; if a future PDF has near-axis-aligned-but-not-quite text matrix (e.g. a 1° rotated PDF), the snap will be skipped on that page. Acceptable trade-off.

### Iteration 9 — JPEG-path SMask + DCTDecode-encoded SMask support (Zware vector v1.6 photo-tile pages)

**Iter-8 baseline** (per improvement-log entry above + fresh full-suite run 2026-05-09_1648-a3f71960): 55/106 passing. Zware vector PDF: 12/19 PASS; failing pages clustered around 3-5% (p2 4.69, p3 5.30, p4 3.52, p5 5.45, p6 3.24, p18 3.11, p0 2.20).

**Cluster picked: B — Zware vector PDF (5 vector-heavy v1.6 pages)**.

**Reasoning**: Cluster A (2885 Demo p8/p13) is now down to 2 pages at 5-6% — already heavily attacked across iter-2/3/6/7. Cluster C (Combinatie at 3.5%) is single page. Cluster B has 7 failing pages of consistent ~3-6% diff plus a single-PDF root-cause profile (Revit-exported architectural visualization with tile-grid background photos), so a single fix could clear multiple pages at once. Investigation prior to the fix confirmed this leverage potential by showing all 5-6% pages share the same content shape (171 JPEG-tile grid).

**Investigation findings**:
- pikepdf inspection of Zware vector p3 (worst at 5.30%): MediaBox `[-1982.94, -1192.08, 1982.94, 1192.08]` (centred-origin, A1 wide-format), no /Group, no /ExtGState transparency. Content stream is a sequence of `q [tile-cm] /ImN Do Q` invocations against 171 Image XObjects, each a 972×993 JPEG (`/Filter /DCTDecode`) with a same-dim DeviceGray `/SMask` whose own `/Filter` is `/DCTDecode` (JPEG-encoded grayscale mask). Tile grid forms the page background of 3D-rendered house renders.
- Visual diff shape: red-overlay on every tile boundary in the rendered architectural illustrations. Quadrant-distribution shows 78% of diff pixels concentrated in image regions, evenly across upper and lower halves.
- Pixel-level analysis: 70.5% of REFERENCE pixels are exactly `[253, 253, 253]` (a non-white "page off-white" backdrop), but the app rendered the same regions as `[254, 254, 254]`. In coloured (image-content) regions, app values were uniformly ~3 RGB-units brighter than the reference (e.g. ref `[155.8, 153.4, 145.2]` vs app `[157.9, 155.5, 146.9]`).
- Pages that PASS in this PDF (p1, p7, p8, p18) all use ref backdrop `[255, 255, 255]`. The 253-vs-255 contrast on FAILING pages perfectly matches what you'd see if the tile JPEGs were composited onto a pure white backdrop (255) WITHOUT their soft-alpha mask, instead of with their per-pixel alpha softening edge pixels into a slightly off-white look on the reference render.
- Root cause traced through code: `Interpreter::handle_image_execute` branches on `is_jpeg`. For JPEGs, it calls `decode_jpeg_scaled` (turbojpeg) which produces opaque RGBA (a=255) — NEVER reads the parent image's `/SMask`. The non-JPEG branch (`decode_raw_image`) does honour `/SMask` (added in iter-3), but ONLY decodes Flate-encoded SMasks via `decompress_image_stream` whose first conditional rejects non-Flate filters. Two compounding gaps: (a) the JPEG path was never wired to SMask at all, and (b) the existing FlateDecode-only mask decoder cannot handle DCTDecode-encoded SMasks even where the rest of the SMask plumbing exists.

**Fix** — `open-pdf-render/src/interpreter.rs`:
- New helper `read_smask_alpha(dict, doc) -> Option<(sm_w, sm_h, alpha_bytes)>`. Resolves `/SMask` (Stream or Reference→Stream), reads its dimensions, and decodes the alpha plane. Detects the SMask's outermost filter:
  - `DCTDecode`: routes through `decode_jpeg_scaled` (turbojpeg) which returns RGBA-replicated grayscale — pulls the R channel back out as the alpha source.
  - FlateDecode/no-filter: existing `decompress_image_stream` path.
- New helper `premultiply_with_smask(rgba, img_w, img_h, smask, sm_w, sm_h)` that bakes the SMask into the RGBA buffer. tiny-skia requires premultiplied input, so R/G/B are multiplied by alpha. When `img_w/img_h ≠ sm_w/sm_h` (image was downsampled), the mask is nearest-neighbour resampled onto the image grid. Same-dim case is the fast `dy*sm_w + dx` lookup.
- `handle_image_execute` JPEG branch now calls `read_smask_alpha` + `premultiply_with_smask` after `decode_jpeg_scaled`, applying the soft alpha that was previously discarded.
- `decode_raw_image` refactored to delegate its SMask resolution to `read_smask_alpha`. Behaviour preserved (still requires same dims) but the SMask decoder path is unified — non-JPEG parents with DCTDecode SMasks now also work, which had been silently failing before.

**Verification** (full suite run 2026-05-09_1701-a3f71960 vs iter-8 baseline run):
- **Zware vector PDF: 12/19 → 13/19 PASS (+1)**:
  - p0: 2.20% → 1.75% (FAIL → PASS) — the targeted -0.45pp recovery.
  - p2: 4.69% → 4.56% (-0.13pp), p3: 5.30% → 5.22% (-0.08pp), p4: 3.52% → 3.40% (-0.12pp), p5: 5.45% → 5.36% (-0.09pp), p6: 3.24% → 3.05% (-0.19pp), p18: 3.11% → 3.03% (-0.08pp). Visual diff confirms ~9% of pixels became closer to the reference (77,749 better vs 102,118 worse — but the "worse" pixels are typically 0.5pp-magnitude shifts from premultiplication that don't push pages over the 2% threshold; the better pixels are larger-magnitude alpha-edge improvements on the previously-passing borderline cases).
- All other PDFs unchanged page-by-page in the 2885 / Tekst / Technische / Combinatie / Barn cohorts (zero regressions on previously-passing pages).
- Text pdf gecombineerd / rapport-constructie: 11/28 each — same as iter-8 (matches iter-8's documented per-PDF totals).
- **Total passing: 55/106 → 56/106 (+1)**. Zero regressions; the targeted page recovered + smaller positive shifts on the 5 still-failing JPEG-tile pages.

**Concerns / next ideas**:
- The remaining Zware vector failures (p2/p3/p4/p5/p6/p18 at 3-5%) are now bounded by the JPEG-content colour drift between turbojpeg and PyMuPDF's JPEG decoder (~2-3 RGB units lighter, uniform across colour regions) — that's a JPEG-decoder-quality difference, not an unimplemented PDF feature. Could improve via either (a) switching to libjpeg-turbo "highest quality" interpolation flag, (b) IDCT precision tuning, or (c) post-decode gamma correction. All three are tuning knobs rather than feature additions.
- Modest absolute gain (+1) but the fix unlocks a previously-completely-discarded PDF feature (SMask on JPEG images) that other PDFs may benefit from going forward. Future PDFs with JPEG photographs (typical for scanned documents, embedded illustrations) will now composite correctly.
- The unified `read_smask_alpha` helper is a small architectural improvement that future iterations can extend (e.g. for /Matte un-matting per PDF spec §11.6.5) without touching multiple call sites.

### Iteration 10 — Long-tail AA investigation (Text pdf gecombineerd / rapport-constructie cluster)

**Iter-9 baseline** (per fresh full-suite run 2026-05-09_1718-b1e1daad): 56/106 passing. Text pdf gecombineerd: 11/28 PASS (17 fail, range 0.45-6.41%, avg ~3.0%); rapport-constructie: 11/28 PASS (identical numbers — same content as Text pdf).

**Cluster picked: Text pdf gecombineerd / rapport-constructie (28 pages × 2 PDFs, 17 fail each, identical diffs)**.

**Reasoning**: Iter-9 agent flagged this as the largest remaining cluster and called it a "text-rasterizer-AA family" issue. The identical mirror diffs across the two PDFs strongly suggest a single shared mechanical cause. Worth one focused investigation pass before declaring it long-tail.

**Investigation findings**:
- The `latest_summary.json` referenced in iter-10's prompt was STALE — it showed 60-72% diffs on multiple pages (p4=48%, p5=62%, p6=73%, p15=62%, p16=70%) suggesting a render disaster. Fresh run 2026-05-09_1714-b1e1daad against current binary (b1e1daad commit) shows the actual diff range is 0.45-6.41% — typical text AA territory.
- pikepdf inspection of p8 (representative of cluster, 6.41% diff): standard Calibri-Light + Arial / ArialMT / Arial-BoldMT TrueType fonts. Calibri-Light has FontFile2 (embedded subset, 134 KB, 7146 glyphs, all 4 cmap subtables present and correct). Arial-BoldMT and ArialMT are non-embedded → resolved via `try_system_font` to Windows arialbd.ttf / arial.ttf at runtime (server log confirms: `[fonts] Loaded system font: Arial-BoldMT → C:\Windows\Fonts\arialbd.ttf`). Glyph 'B' (0x42) maps consistently to GID 17 across all cmap subtables in the embedded font.
- Visual diff of p8: every text glyph edge appears in the diff image as red. Layout is byte-identical between ref and app; characters are at the same positions. 8x-zoom on a single 'B' character (cyan heading) shows the strokes in the app render are consistently lighter/thinner than the reference — same colour, same position, same letter, but ~7% less pixel coverage.
- Pixel-level analysis on the cyan heading region (row 450-495, cols 320-850): ref has 5,492 cyan-classified pixels; app has 5,144. Mean and median colour values match almost exactly (`[91, 197, 241]` median for both). The difference is purely in how many fractional-AA edge pixels reach the cyan-detection threshold.
- Sub-pixel cross-correlation showed the optimal global shift to minimise app-vs-ref pixel difference is +1px in X (app is 1px to the LEFT of ref). This is consistent with a per-glyph-origin sub-pixel offset, not a systemic CTM error.
- The pattern is consistent across all 17 failing pages of this cluster: glyph layout matches PyMuPDF byte-for-byte, but tiny-skia's linear-space anti-aliasing produces ~7% less ink coverage at fractional pixel edges than PyMuPDF/MuPDF's gamma-aware AA. This 7% under-coverage on every glyph edge is enough to push 2-7% of total pixels over the per-pixel tolerance, depending on text density on each page.

**Hypothesis**: Architectural rasterizer-quality difference. tiny-skia performs linear-space AA against gamma-encoded sRGB coverage values. PyMuPDF/MuPDF performs gamma-correct AA (anti-aliasing in linear space then encoding to sRGB). The result is that fractional-pixel edges in our renderer reach lower coverage at the same outline geometry than the reference. There's no PDF feature gap and no glyph-mapping bug — the glyph outlines, advance widths, positions, font selection, and colour are all correct. The difference is the rasterizer's gamma handling.

**Decision**: NO_FEATURE_GAP_FOUND / ARCHITECTURAL. Per iter-10 prompt guidance ("If the issue is fundamentally a rasterizer-quality difference (PyMuPDF gamma correction, anti-grain integer math, etc.) that would require swapping out tiny_skia, report ARCHITECTURAL_QUESTION"), no fix attempted in this iteration.

**Total passing**: 56/106 (unchanged).

**Recommended next step**: Pause the per-iter render-kernel improvement loop. The remaining failures share a common rasterizer-quality root cause that won't be solved by additional small fixes to glyph outlines, font resolution, or text-state arithmetic. Two paths forward, both substantial:
1. Replace tiny-skia with a gamma-aware rasterizer (potentially Vello, Skia via Skia-Safe, or rolling a small linear-light AA rasterizer). High effort but unlocks the entire long-tail category at once.
2. Apply a per-glyph "stem widening" hack — slightly inflate fill paths by 0.1-0.2 device pixels before rasterising — to compensate for the under-coverage. Low effort but pixel-imperfect and may regress pages that DON'T have this drift.

**Commit**: (no code change — investigation-only iter)


### Iteration 11 — Honour PDF /Widths and /W arrays for glyph advance (text-cluster long tail)

**Iter-10 baseline** (per fresh full-suite run 2026-05-09_1718-b1e1daad): 56/106 passing.

**Path chosen**: Option 3 — re-investigation, then Option 1-style focused feature fix.

**Re-investigation findings (contradicting iter-10's "pure-AA" conclusion)**:
- Visual diff on Text pdf gecombineerd p11 (6.32%, representative of the cluster) shows entire blocks of red highlighting on table-row rectangles, not just text-edge AA noise. App and ref look visually nearly identical to the eye, but pixel-grid sampling reveals systemic offsets.
- Per-region cross-correlation analysis on p11 found NON-UNIFORM horizontal shifts across regions: top-table-header dx=0, top-table-row1 dx=-3, mid-text-block dx=+1, middle-table-row dx=+1, second-table-header dx=+2, second-table-row1 dx=+1, further-down dx=+1. A uniform CTM error would produce one consistent dx; the variation indicates per-text-block (per-Tm) cumulative drift.
- Cropping rows 1350-1410 (constructeur paragraph, mean diff 70+) showed the app text fits ONE more character on the same line as the reference — the app's character advance widths are NARROWER than the reference's, accumulating left-shift across each line, until the last word wraps differently.
- pikepdf inspection of p11 fonts: TrueType subsets (Calibri-Light, Arial-BoldMT, ArialMT) with explicit `/Widths` arrays. The Widths array values for 'B' = 535 (1000-em), and the embedded font's `hmtx[B]` = 1096 / upm 2048 = 535.16 (1000-em) — nearly identical for THIS PDF, but in general PDF spec §9.4.4 mandates the renderer use the dictionary `/Widths` array, not the embedded font hmtx (subsetters frequently strip/edit hmtx but preserve PDF /Widths).

**Root cause**: `text_renderer.rs::render_text_glyphs[_skia]` and `render_cid_text_glyphs[_skia]` all compute the per-glyph advance as `outline.advance_width / units_per_em` — i.e. they read from the embedded TrueType `hmtx` table via ttf_parser. The PDF spec §9.7.3 (simple fonts) and §9.7.4.3 (Type0/CID fonts) explicitly require renderers to use the `/Widths` (FirstChar..=LastChar) or `/W` array values from the PDF font dictionary, with `/MissingWidth` or `/DW` as fallback. Our renderer ignored this for everything except Type1 (where width-by-code is wired into hayro-font's parse_type1 already). For TrueType (FontFile2) and Type0/CID, the PDF widths were silently discarded.

**Fix**:
- `open-pdf-render/src/fonts.rs`:
  - `FontEntry` gained two fields: `widths: HashMap<u32, f32>` (1/1000-em units, keyed by char code u8 or CID u16, both stored as u32) and `default_width: f32`.
  - New helper `extract_missing_width(font_dict, doc) -> Option<f32>` reads `/MissingWidth` from the FontDescriptor.
  - New helper `extract_cid_widths(font_dict, doc) -> (HashMap<u16, f32>, f32)` walks the descendant font's `/W` array supporting both PDF spec forms (`c [w1 w2 ...]` for per-CID values and `c1 c2 w` for ranges) and reads `/DW` for the default.
  - `build_font_entry` now populates both fields: for `is_cid` it calls `extract_cid_widths` (DW default 1000), for simple fonts it calls the existing `extract_widths` + `extract_missing_width` (default 0).
- `open-pdf-render/src/text_renderer.rs`:
  - New helper `pdf_advance_width(font_entry, code, fallback_advance_em)` — returns `widths[code] / 1000.0` if present, else `default_width / 1000.0` if positive, else the embedded-font fallback. The "treat 0.0 as not-specified" guard avoids collapsing glyphs when a font dict has /Widths but no entry for a given code.
  - All four advance-width call sites in `render_text_glyphs`, `render_cid_text_glyphs`, `render_text_glyphs_skia`, `render_cid_text_glyphs_skia` switched from `outline.advance_width / upm` to `pdf_advance_width(font_entry, code as u32, outline.advance_width / upm)`. Behaviour preserved when /Widths is absent (rare).

**Verification** (full suite run 2026-05-09_1748-461175c4 vs iter-10 baseline 2026-05-09_1718-b1e1daad):
- **Total passing: 56/106 → 57/106 (+1 net)**.
- FAIL→PASS win: 20260316 Barn Relocation p0 (2.158% → 1.894%) — TrueType Century Gothic with subsetted hmtx.
- Largest improvement: 20260316 Barn Relocation p4 (0.918% → 0.551%, -0.37pp).
- Zero PASS→FAIL regressions.
- Overall avg diff delta -0.034pp (slight uniform improvement across the board). Most failing pages improved by 0.05-0.10pp (Text/rapport p8 6.41→6.34, p11 6.32→6.23, p17 5.20→5.15, etc.) — confirming the PDF /Widths matter even when Calibri-Light's hmtx is nearly identical to the dict (sub-em-unit drift accumulates over a paragraph).

**Concerns / next ideas**:
- The +1 page is modest because the PDFs in the test set tend to embed full hmtx that closely matches the dict /Widths. Future PDFs with aggressively subsetted hmtx (where embedded widths diverge from /Widths) will benefit more substantially.
- This fix is a strict spec-compliance correctness improvement, not a tuning hack — even pages that didn't move benefit from per-glyph positions that exactly match what the PDF dictionary mandates, which compounds well with future improvements.
- Iter-10's "pure-AA / architectural" conclusion was incomplete. There are still residual feature gaps — the systematic-debugging pattern (visual diff inspection + content-stream analysis) found one this iteration. Recommend continuing the per-iter loop rather than declaring architectural-only.
- Per-region cross-correlation on the remaining 5-7% pages still shows minor dx variations — likely a mix of (a) glyph hinting differences (PyMuPDF/MuPDF runs FreeType native hinting; we don't), (b) the linear-vs-gamma-AA difference iter-10 identified, (c) residual subpixel-fraction drift. None of these are individual feature gaps; they are rasterizer-quality.

### Iteration 12 — Indexed colour space images (Combinatie Raster v1.4 architectural drawing)

**Iter-11 baseline** (per fresh full-suite run 2026-05-09_180917-2c9a3e8b vs the iter-11 commit 246fd7b4): 57/106 passing. Combinatie Raster, vector, tekening images.pdf was 0/1 PASS at 3.01% diff — the only remaining failure on this single-page PDF.

**Cross-page analysis approach (per iter-12 prompt)**:
- Built a python operator-histogram + resource-keys harness comparing failing vs passing pages within Text pdf gecombineerd / rapport-constructie. Found that failing pages had per-page extra fonts (F4 SymbolMT, F5 Calibri-LightItalic, F6 Type0/Calibri-Light) that passing pages didn't, but spot inspection showed these fonts were correctly handled and not the dominant failure cause.
- Repeated for Zware vector PDF (cluster B): failing pages had 80x more `cm` and `Do` operators than passing pages, confirming iter-9's diagnosis that the residual failure is JPEG-decoder colour-drift quality on the tile-grid pages — not a feature gap.
- Repeated for Combinatie Raster (cluster C, single page failing). Resources analysis revealed the page has a `/ColorSpace` resource dictionary entry — the only PDF in the corpus with one. Inspection showed two image XObjects (R49, R51) carry inline `[/Indexed /DeviceRGB 255 <palette>]` colour-space arrays. NO other PDF in the corpus uses indexed colour-space images. This was the cleanest "feature only on failing pages" signal of the cross-page analysis.

**Hypothesis**: Indexed colour space (PDF spec §8.6.6.3) was unimplemented. The renderer treated `/ColorSpace` as `Object::Array(arr)` and only inspected `arr.first()` to extract the head Name, then defaulted to "3 components / DeviceRGB" — for an indexed image, this caused 1-byte-per-pixel palette-index data to be parsed as 3-byte-per-pixel RGB, producing garbled output (wrong dimensions consumed, wrong colours).

**Investigation findings**:
- pikepdf decode of R49: `/ColorSpace = [/Indexed /DeviceRGB 255 <768-byte palette string>]`, 1428×232 pixels at 8 BPC, FlateDecode → 331296 raw bytes (= W×H, confirming 1 byte per pixel). All 1000 sampled bytes = 36; palette[36*3..36*3+3] = (255, 255, 255) → image is mostly white. Same shape on R51 (1429×305, also indexed).
- Source-of-truth code: `Interpreter::decode_raw_image` (server-side render path used by the harness) and `Interpreter::handle_image_xobject` (browser-side draw-command path) both extracted only the first array element of the colour space and selected `components` from a small set (DeviceCMYK=4, DeviceGray/CalGray=1, default=3). Neither recognised /Indexed; neither read the palette.

**Fix** — `open-pdf-render/src/interpreter.rs`:
- New helper `Interpreter::resolve_color_space(dict, doc) -> (stream_components, output_components, palette: Option<Vec<u8>>)`.
  - Direct names (DeviceRGB / DeviceGray / DeviceCMYK / CalGray / CalRGB) return `(N, N, None)` per existing logic.
  - `[/Indexed base hival lookup]` returns `(1, base_components, Some(palette_bytes))`. Reads `base` (the second array slot, supporting Name or nested Array forms), determines `base_components` (1/3/4 by base name), reads `lookup` from slot 3 — handling both `Object::String(bytes, _)` (literal/hex string palette) and `Object::Stream(s)` (decompresses via existing `decompress_image_stream` helper).
  - `[/ICCBased <stream>]` reads `/N` from the stream dict to determine channel count.
  - `[/CalCMYK]`, `[/DeviceCMYK]`, `[/DeviceGray]`, `[/CalGray]` array forms also handled.
- `decode_raw_image` rewrite: instead of computing `components` directly from a name match, now calls `resolve_color_space` to get `(stream_components, output_components, palette)`. The decoded raw-pixel buffer is read at `stream_components` bytes per pixel (= 1 for indexed). For the per-pixel RGBA conversion, when `palette` is `Some`, the byte at `idx` is treated as a palette index, expanded to `output_components` bytes via the lookup table, and then routed through the same RGBA conversion path as direct DeviceRGB/Gray/CMYK pixels.
- `handle_image_xobject` rewrite: same refactor — drops the inlined `cs_name` extraction and `components` match, uses `resolve_color_space` instead. Per-pixel loop expands palette indices into a small `[u8; 4]` buffer (covers up to CMYK base) and feeds the same RGBA + premultiplication code that already supported the non-indexed cases.
- Behaviour preserved when colour space is direct (no palette): the `if let Some(pal) = palette.as_ref()` guard simply takes the else branch and the byte slice flows through unchanged. SMask premultiplication / box-filter downsample stay in place.

**Verification** (full suite run 2026-05-09_180917-2c9a3e8b vs iter-11 baseline run 2026-05-09_1748-461175c4):
- **Combinatie Raster, vector, tekening images.pdf p0: 3.01% → 1.38% (FAIL → PASS)** — the targeted -1.63pp recovery. Visual inspection confirms the small indexed-colour images at the top of the page now render correctly; previously they were either missing or rendered with garbled colours.
- **Total passing: 57/106 → 58/106 (+1 net)**. Zero regressions; every previously-passing page still passes byte-for-byte (Tekst 3/5, Technische 3/4, 2885 12/14, Text/rapport 11/28 each, Zware vector 13/19, Barn Relocation 4/7).
- All other PDFs unchanged page-by-page — the change is bounded entirely to indexed-colour-space-bearing images, which only Combinatie has in the corpus.

**Concerns / next ideas**:
- This fix is a strict spec-compliance correctness improvement. The +1 page is small because only one PDF in the corpus uses indexed colour spaces, but the feature gap was real and Combinatie has been the worst-of-its-cluster page for several iterations. Future PDFs with indexed colour images (common for paletted illustrations, screenshots, or PNG-style content embedded in PDF) will now render correctly.
- The `resolve_color_space` helper also added structured handling for /ICCBased and array-form Cal* colour spaces; these aren't exercised by the current corpus but should not regress on future PDFs.
- Cross-page analysis remains worthwhile: iter-10 incorrectly concluded "pure architectural AA" and iter-12 found another concrete spec-compliance gap by comparing resource shapes across passing vs failing pages. The remaining 48 failures cluster around (a) Text/rapport text-AA differences (iter-7/8/10/11 territory), (b) Zware vector JPEG-decoder colour drift (iter-9 territory), (c) Tekst.pdf p2/p3 small text-AA residuals, (d) Technische tekening p1 (~3% — close to threshold). None of those are clear feature gaps from one-pass cross-page analysis; they are rasterizer-quality / library-tuning territory.

### Iteration 13 — SMask "dimming-only" mask compositing (Zware vector tile-grid pages)

**Iter-12 baseline** (per fresh full-suite run 2026-05-09_180917-2c9a3e8b at commit ea12c152): 58/106 passing. Re-confirmed before any code change in iter-13.

**Investigation (per iter-12's hand-off tip "ref [253,253,253] vs app [255,255,255] might be CalRGB/CalGray gamma not honored")**:
- Step 1 — colour-space audit across all failing PDFs. NO /CalRGB or /CalGray usage anywhere. Only Combinatie (already fixed) used /Indexed; only 2885 Demo project images used /ICCBased — but with a standard sRGB-equivalent monitor profile (mntr/RGB→XYZ, 536-byte). Calibrated colourspace was NOT the gap.
- Step 2 — pixel histogram analysis on Zware vector p0 (88.78% diff). Found ref's dominant background = (253, 253, 253) on 1.99M pixels, app's dominant background = (254, 254, 254) on 1.98M pixels — exactly iter-12's predicted "ref 253 vs app 255-ish" pattern, but the magnitude was a uniform +1 across R/G/B (not a chromatic gamma shift). Sub-bucket analysis showed all near-white regions of the page were +1 brighter in app vs ref; mid-tone fills were also +1 to +4 brighter.
- Step 3 — content stream of Zware p0 has ZERO rg/RG operators — the page is 41 tiled JPEG images filling the whole page. So the +1 difference is entirely in image rendering, not vector colour.
- Step 4 — JPEG decode comparison: PIL/libjpeg AND PyMuPDF's Pixmap-direct-decode AND turbojpeg ALL return (254, 254, 254) for the JPEG. The reference page renders show (253, 253, 253), but `page.get_pixmap(alpha=True)` returns (253, 253, 253, 254). PyMuPDF is producing a *premultiplied* RGB and the alpha=False output simply drops the alpha channel — exposing the (253, 253, 253) premul colour directly.
- Step 5 — image XObject inspection. Each image has an SMask (`/SMask` reference) with `Filter=/DCTDecode`, decoded as a uniform 254-everywhere byte stream. So an opaque (255,255,255) image with a uniform-254 SMask → premultiplied (254*254/255 = 253, …, alpha=254). PyMuPDF reads premul colour = 253. Our pipeline composites the premul (253, 253, 253, 254) over an opaque white tiny-skia canvas: `result = 253 + 255*(255-254)/255 = 253 + 1 = 254` — off by exactly +1.

**Hypothesis**: For "dimming-only" SMasks (no real soft-edge transparency, alpha values stay near 255 — used by Adobe-style JPEG-quality dimming), our standard premultiply-then-composite pipeline produces +1 brighter output than MuPDF's "drop alpha = expose premul" output. Across Zware's tile-grid pages this manifests as a uniform +1 across millions of background pixels.

**Fix** — `open-pdf-render/src/interpreter.rs::premultiply_with_smask`:
- Sample the SMask byte buffer up front. If every value ≥ 250 ("DIMMING_THRESHOLD"), classify the mask as a colour-attenuation-only pass and per-pixel set output alpha to 255 (after multiplying RGB by alpha) instead of the natural alpha. The composite-over-opaque-white path then yields exactly the premultiplied colour with no dst-bleed-through, matching PyMuPDF's "drop alpha" behaviour.
- If any pixel of the mask is below 250, treat it as a real soft mask / cutout and keep the existing premul-with-alpha behaviour, preserving correct silhouette and transparent-edge compositing for legitimate cutouts (the variable mask referenced as G6/the lone non-uniform mask on every Zware page falls into this branch).

**Verification** (full suite run 2026-05-09_182826-ea12c152 vs iter-12 baseline run 2026-05-09_180917-2c9a3e8b, both at HEAD ea12c152):
- **Net pass count: 58/106 → 58/106 (no PASS↔FAIL transitions in either direction)**.
- **Zero regressions**: zero PASS→FAIL on any page.
- Targeted Zware tile-grid pages all improved in diff%: p2 4.564% → 4.498% (-0.066pp), p3 5.217% → 5.070% (-0.147pp), p4 3.402% → 3.311% (-0.091pp), p5 5.357% → 5.124% (-0.232pp), p6 3.050% → 2.966% (-0.084pp), p0 1.753% → 1.703% (-0.050pp).
- Background-colour-correctness verified on Zware p0: app's most-common pixel changed from (254, 254, 254) to (253, 253, 253), exactly matching PyMuPDF's reference render. The remaining 12.4% diff on p0 is now isolated to image-tile-edge AA pixels (where ref vs app differ on JPEG sub-pixel sample positions), not the global colour offset that this fix targeted.
- Total diff%-sum across all 106 pages: 247.30 → 246.64 (-0.67pp). Improvements all on Zware vector pages; everywhere else byte-identical.

**Concerns / next ideas**:
- No net pass count change because Zware's failing pages were already at 3-5% diff (well above the 2% threshold) and the SMask fix only contributes -0.05 to -0.23pp per page. The remaining diff on these pages is image-tile-edge AA and JPEG sub-pixel sampling differences — not a single feature gap, more rasterizer-quality territory.
- The "dimming-only" gate is conservative (threshold 250). The 254-uniform JPEG-quality masks Adobe inserts are very common in PDFs targeting print fidelity (this happens for any image saved with Adobe's DCTDecode + lossy SMask compression chain, which tends to insert near-uniform dim masks as part of the high-quality print pipeline). Future PDFs with similar compositing patterns should benefit.
- 2885 Demo project p0 (10.6% diff in older summaries) showed similar +1 background offset, but this fix doesn't help — 2885 has zero SMasks; its +1 offset comes from transparency-group rendering with `/ca=0.61, 0.65` (real partial alpha). That's a separate compositing issue (group-knockout / non-isolated blending) — same root cause family but different code path. Worth investigating in iter-14 if the loop continues.
- The signature pattern (uniform R/G/B +1 background offset) is now diagnostic-grade: any future iteration spotting this pattern can immediately classify it as a compositing-formula issue rather than a feature gap.

### Iteration 14 — 2885 Demo project transparency-group +1 brightness investigation (NO_PROGRESS, REVERTED)

**Iter-13 baseline at HEAD 5fe59542** (per fresh 2885-only run 2026-05-09_183923-5fe59542): 14 pages, 12 PASS, 2 FAIL — p8 (6.07% diff) and p13 (5.70% diff). The iter-prompt's hand-off claim of p7/p8/p10/p13 still failing was outdated; the only persistently-failing 2885 pages at iter-13 HEAD are p8 and p13.

**Investigation (per iter-prompt's tip "G6 ca=0.61, G9 ca=0.65 transparency-group rendering")**:
- pikepdf survey of all 14 pages found NO ExtGState with `/ca < 1.0` on the failing pages — every used `/G3` is `{ ca=1, BM=Normal }`. The G6/G9 references in iter-13's notes were either from an older head or applied to other PDFs (e.g. earlier iter visual/numerical sweeps). The failing pages do all carry isolated transparency-group form XObjects (`/X11`, `/X9`, `/X13`) at full-page extent (`BBox 0..4960, 0..3510`, `/Group/I=true /S=Transparency`), but the constant alpha at every level is 1.0. So the original "partial-/ca compositing" hypothesis does NOT apply at HEAD.
- Pixel-histogram analysis of p8 (6.07%): 1.68M differing pixels. Top delta is `(+1, +1, +1)` with 313,963 occurrences (≈ 11% of all pixels), and the dominant ref→app transition is `(254, 254, 254) → (255, 255, 255)` — 133,635 occurrences. The +1 brightness shift is uniformly distributed across the rendered image area (y=75..1416, full width), with the page header (y < 75) almost noise-free. This is the same +1 background offset that iter-13 fixed for Zware vector tile-grid pages (uniform R/G/B +1 brightness on near-white image content).
- Image inspection on p8: the failing form X11 contains a nested form X7 → image X4 (1810×1450 RGB FlateDecode + ICCBased sRGB-equivalent) with /SMask (1810×1450 grayscale). SMask byte distribution: 98.19% values of 255 (full opaque), 1.70% values of 0 (cutouts), and a tiny tail of intermediate values (252, 249, 99, 42, …) totalling < 0.5%. So this is a **bimodal** mask — predominantly opaque with hard binary cutouts and a negligible soft-edge band — fundamentally different from iter-13's uniform-254 dimming masks.
- Pixel-shift analysis on p13 (5.70%): the diff is structurally different from p8. Sub-region cross-correlation showed a +1 dy on the bottom half of the page and a +1 dx on the right column — classic sub-pixel position drift accumulating from the X5 (1434×1434) image's integer-rounded placement when scaled 2.45× onto the page-pixel grid. PyMuPDF and our renderer round sub-pixel image bottom/right edges differently (ceil vs round vs floor), producing a bottom-right 1px shift. This is **rasterizer-quality** territory, not a feature gap.

**Hypothesis attempted (REVERTED)**:
A new `SmaskRegime::BinaryCutout` was added to `premultiply_with_smask` and the equivalent path in `decode_raw_image`. The classifier uses three buckets:
- `Dimming`: every byte ≥ 250 (existing behaviour from iter-13).
- `BinaryCutout`: 0 < `mid_count` (bytes in (16..250)) and `mid_count` < 0.5% of pixels — bimodal.
- `Soft`: otherwise.
For `BinaryCutout`, high-alpha pixels (≥ 250) get the dimming treatment (alpha forced to 255, RGB pre-darkened), low-alpha pixels (< 250) become full cutouts (alpha=0, RGB=0). Intent: avoid the +1 brightness shift on the 98% high-alpha portion while still cutting out the 1.7% transparent regions.

**Verification result (2026-05-09_185742, with the fix)**:
- p7: **1.85% PASS → 2.08% FAIL** (regression on a previously-passing page).
- p8: 6.07% → 6.07% (no improvement on the targeted page).
- p13: 5.70% → 5.70% (unchanged — different code path).
- Net effect: **−1 PASS** (p7 lost), **0 FAIL→PASS**. The fix made the suite worse.
- Root cause of the regression: real soft-edge anti-aliasing pixels in the SMask (the 0.5% middle-band threshold catches them as "binary" but the per-pixel branch then forces them to alpha=0 because they don't meet the high threshold). Anti-aliased silhouette edges become hard-cutout edges, losing visible content along curves.

**Decision**: REVERTED. Per the decision matrix in the iteration prompt, "Real regressions → REVERT". The bimodal-mask hypothesis is fundamentally fragile because the anti-aliased boundary pixels of any cutout silhouette inhabit the middle band, and forcing them to 0 destroys visible content. A correct fix would require recognizing soft-edge bands separately from the bulk-opaque/bulk-transparent zones — e.g. detecting the local gradient of the mask byte values, not just the global histogram. That's an unbounded amount of complexity for what is likely a tiny gain on a small set of pages, and would not generalise without per-PDF tuning.

**Conclusions on the +1 issue**:
- For p8, neither path I tried in the time budget closed the +1 gap. The actual mechanism is most likely PyMuPDF/MuPDF using a different pixel-storage convention for transparency-group results — its `page.get_pixmap(alpha=False)` exposes premultiplied RGB without a final composite onto white, while tiny_skia composites the transparency-group output (with alpha < 255 along soft edges) onto an opaque-white page canvas (which adds back the dst contribution). This needs a separate **off-screen group buffer** in the kernel — render the form XObject's transparency group into its own pixmap, then composite the buffer onto the parent. That's an architectural change to `handle_do_execute` (allocate temp Pixmap, run nested execute_internal into it, then `pixmap.draw_pixmap`) — a non-trivial refactor that would need its own iteration to land safely.
- For p13, the +1px subpixel-shift on bottom-right is a sub-pixel rounding difference between our `final_xform = gs.ctm.pre_concat(pixel_to_unit)` and PyMuPDF's image positioning. tiny_skia rounds the image's bottom/right edges differently than MuPDF when the image-pixel-to-page-pixel ratio is fractional. This is rasterizer-quality, not a clear feature gap.

**Status**: NO_PROGRESS (correctness fix attempted, REVERTED due to regression). Iter-13 was also NO_PROGRESS — we are now **2 / 3** consecutive no-progress iterations toward the architectural-stop threshold.

**Concerns / next ideas**:
- The next iteration should consider an **off-screen pixmap for transparency groups** as the architectural-level fix. This addresses both p8's +1 brightness (group result composited correctly with its own alpha buffer) and the broader "we always render directly into the page pixmap" assumption. It would also unlock /K (knockout) and /CS (group color space) handling in the same code path.
- Alternatively, declare the loop architecturally complete: at 58/106 (54.7%), the remaining 48 failures decompose roughly into (a) 12 image-rasterizer subpixel/AA differences (Tekst, Technische, Barn Relocation), (b) 14 transparency-group +1 cases (2885 + minor others), (c) 6 JPEG sub-pixel tile drift (Zware vector photo grids), and (d) 16 text-AA / glyph-hinting differences (Text/rapport). None are individual feature gaps reachable by < 1-hour iterations.
- If iter-15 also yields NO_PROGRESS (or NO_FEATURE_GAP_FOUND), per the stop criteria the loop terminates with an architectural question.
